Quarterly US GDP growth series used as the dependent variable in the replication.
}
\details{
The original series contains quarterly GDP levels for 63 countries.
For replication, all series are converted to log-differenced annualized growth rates
(\code{diff(log(x)) * 400}). From this dataset, the U.S. series is extracted
and the first observation dropped to obtain 59 observations in total.
